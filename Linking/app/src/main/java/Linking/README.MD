# Singly Linked List
The singly linked list is a linear data structure in which each element of the list contains a pointer which points to the next element in the list

## Challenge
Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the Node, and a pointer to the next Node.
Create a Linked List class
Within your Linked List class, include a head property.
Upon instantiation, an empty Linked List should be created.
The class should contain the following methods
insert
includes
to string
## Approach & Efficiency
o(N)

## API
### insert:
Arguments: value
Returns: nothing
Adds a new node with that value to the head of the list with an O(1) Time performance.
### includes:
Arguments: value
Returns: Boolean
Indicates whether that value exists as a Nodeâ€™s value somewhere within the list.
### to string:
Arguments: none
Returns: a string representing all the values in the Linked List, formatted as:
"[ a ] -> [ b ] -> [ c ] -> NULL"
---
# Challenge Summary
Write the following methods for the Linked List class:
append
arguments: new value
adds a new node with the given value to the end of the list
insert before
arguments: value, new value
adds a new node with the given new value immediately before the first node that has the value specified
insert after
arguments: value, new value
adds a new node with the given new value immediately after the first node that has the value specified
