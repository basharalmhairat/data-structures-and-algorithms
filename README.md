# Challenge Summary
Write the following methods for the Linked List class:
append
adds a new node with the given value to the end of the list
insert before
adds a new node with the given new value immediately before the first node that has the value specified
insert after
adds a new node with the given new value immediately after the first node that has the value specified

# Challenge Summary
Write the following method for the Linked List class:

kth from end
argument: a number, k, as a parameter.
Return the nodeâ€™s value that is k places from the tail of the linked list.
You have access to the Node class and all the properties on the Linked List class as well as the methods created in previous challenges.

# Challenge Summary
Write a function called zip lists
Arguments: 2 linked lists
Return: New Linked List, zipped as noted below
Zip the two linked lists together into one so that the nodes alternate between the two lists and return a reference to the the zipped list.
Try and keep additional space down to O(1)
You have access to the Node class and all the properties on the Linked List class as well as the methods created in previous challenges.
